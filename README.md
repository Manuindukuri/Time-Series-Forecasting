# Project Overview
This project focuses on applying advanced deep learning techniques, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for effective time series forecasting. Time series forecasting is a critical component in numerous domains, including finance, weather prediction, and demand planning. The objective is to leverage the power of deep learning to capture complex temporal patterns and dependencies in time series data, offering a robust alternative to traditional statistical methods.

# Data Description
The dataset, compiled from public sources, consists of daily temperatures and precipitation from 13 Canadian centers, starting from 1961. The data undergoes several preprocessing steps to prepare it for the deep learning model. These steps include normalization to scale the data, handling missing values, and potentially transforming the data to make it more suitable for modeling by LSTM networks.

# Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing step involves handling missing values in the dataset through various imputation techniques. The data, observed at daily frequency, is visualized to understand its distributions and seasonal patterns.

### Data Imputation
Several imputation techniques are explored to handle missing values in the dataset. These techniques might include statistical methods like mean imputation, as well as more sophisticated methods like imputation using deep learning models. The impact of these imputation methods on the model's performance is analyzed.

### Deep Learning Models for Forecasting
Deep learning models, specifically LSTM networks (a type of RNN), are chosen for their ability to model complex nonlinear patterns and dependencies in time series data. These models are effective in capturing the temporal patterns in weather data, which is not easily modeled using traditional statistical methods like ARIMA.

### Model Building
Several LSTM-based models are built to forecast the weather data. The models are trained on 80% of the data, using a sliding window approach for predictions. The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics like RMSE and R-squared values.

## Findings and Performance Evaluation
### Imputation Techniques
The project explores different imputation techniques to manage missing values in the dataset. The effectiveness of these techniques is assessed based on the performance of the subsequent forecasting models.

### Model Comparisons
- Model 1: Utilizes data imputed by deep learning techniques.
- Model 2: Employs time interpolation for imputation.
- Model 3: Uses linear imputation methods.
The comparison reveals that deep learning-imputed data leads to better R-squared values, indicating superior forecasting performance.

### Model Performance
The LSTM models demonstrate promising results, with an RMSE of 0.13, suggesting high accuracy in forecasting the weather data. The models' ability to predict weather conditions effectively is validated through these performance metrics.


### Best Practices and Strategies
Throughout the project, several best practices and strategies are employed:
- Thorough data preprocessing and imputation to ensure model input quality.
- Exploration of various LSTM configurations to identify the most effective architecture.
- Implementation of dropout and other regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
- Systematic hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.

### Challenges and Solutions
Key challenges faced in the project include selecting the optimal imputation method and fine-tuning the LSTM architectures. Solutions involved extensive experimentation and performance analysis to identify the best approaches.

# Conclusion
This project illustrates the potential of deep learning models, particularly LSTM networks, in effectively forecasting time series data. By comparing different imputation methods and LSTM architectures, the project sheds light on optimizing forecasting models for complex time series data like weather conditions.
